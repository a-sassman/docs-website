Are you having problems [working on a doc in GitHub](/docs/style-guide/writer-workflow/tech-writer-workflow/)? Check out the following common issues.

## SSH authentication fails [#authentication-fail]

### Problem

You can no longer push to your remote branch in GitHub Desktop.

### Solution 

Solution collpaser: Re-log in to GitHub Desktop

In GitHub Desktop, go to Preferences and log out/back in.

Solution collapser: Check for a SSH authentication issue

From the command line, manually push a PR using the command line. For example: `git push --set-upstream origin second-kafka-pr-for-issue-1123` 

If you have an SSH issue, the CL will return an authentication error message. If the response to this command prompts you for a passphrase, your SSH was somehow confused. By entering your passphrase, you should be back in business. If you can’t remember your passphrase, [check out this article](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/troubleshooting-ssh/recovering-your-ssh-key-passphrase).

## Gatsby build fails [#build-fails]

### Problem

The Gatsby build fails to build a PR due.

### Solution

Collapsor: Check for markdown mistakes.

* nav files 
  * Check for improper identation of the nav files.
* `frontmatter` fields 
  * If there are apostrophes or colons in frontmatter fields, surround them with quotes to avoid problems.
* Brackets/tags
  * Check for missing closed brackets or tags.
* Image links 
  * Be careful when renaming images and their filename paths. A mismatch can cause the entire local build to fail.
  * Be especially careful when dealing with image files that are imported.
* Image filenames 
  * Image filenames are case-sensitive. Using the wrong capitalization results in a missing image in the doc.
  * Images with encoded values (like `%`) in the filename can be especially tricky, try to avoid them.

Collapsor: Diagnose markdown errors with yarn-verify [#yarn-verify]

If you know which file is causing an error, you can further troubleshoot with the `yarn verify-mdx path/to/file.mdx` command. This command returns more information about the error than the normal Gatsby output. This includes things such as the specific character and line number causing the error.

    Let's pretend I've made a changes to multiple docs in my branch. When I try to either run the site locally or access the Gatsby Cloud build, I get the following error:

    ```
    Unexpected character = (U+003D) before name, expected a character that can start a name, such as a letter, $, or _/usr/src/app/www/src/content/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/uptime-performance-reliability/aqm-implementation-guide.mdx: Unexpected character = (U+003D) before name, expected a character that can start a name, such as a letter, $, or _
    ```

    The error does tell me that the doc with an error is `/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/uptime-performance-reliability/aqm-implementation-guide.mdx`. Other than that, all I know is that there is a `=` character messing things up somewhere. Cool, but this is a NRQL doc, there are a dozens of `=` characters.

    So, I run `yarn verify-mdx src/content/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/uptime-performance-reliability/aqm-implementation-guide.mdx`. This returns the following:

    ```
    reading src/content/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/uptime-performance-reliability/aqm-implementation-guide.mdx
    {
      "message": "Unexpected character `=` (U+003D) before name, expected a character that can start a name, such as a letter, `$`, or `_`",
      "name": "284:227",
      "reason": "Unexpected character `=` (U+003D) before name, expected a character that can start a name, such as a letter, `$`, or `_`",
      "line": 284,
      "column": 227,
      "location": {
        "start": {
          "line": 284,
          "column": 227,
          "offset": 19129,
          "index": 1
        },
        "end": {
          "line": null,
          "column": null
        }
      },
      "source": "remark-mdx",
      "ruleId": "unexpected-character",
      "fatal": true
    }
    [
    ```

    In this case, the relvant info is:

    ```
    "line": 284,
    "column": 227,
    ```

    and

    ```
    "source": "remark-mdx",
    "ruleId": "unexpected-character",
    "fatal": true
    ```

    This tells me that there is an unexpected character in line 284, column 227. Then I can go to that section of the doc and further troubleshoot, knowing exactly where the error comes from. In this case, I likely just need to wrap a NRQL example in quotes.

## Port 8000 is unavailable [#local-site]

### Problem

When you try to run `yarn start`, the terminal responds:
```
Something is already
running at port 8000. Would you like to run the app at another port instead?
```

### Solution

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id=""
    title="Kill services running on localhost:8000"
  >
To kill all services running on `localhost:8000`:
1. In the terminal, ensure you're in the `/docs-website` directory.
2. Run this command:
  ```
  kill -9 $(lsof -i TCP:8000 | grep LISTEN | awk '{print $2}')
  ```

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="restart-yarn"
    title="Stop and restart yarn"
  >
To stop and restart yarn:
    1. In the terminal, ensure you're in the `/docs-website` directory.
    2. Hit CONTROL+C to interrupt the yarn process, if necessary.
    3. Run this command:
    ```
    yarn && yarn start
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="check-branch"
    title="Identify the problematic branch"
  >
  To identify which branch is causing issues:
    1. In the terminal, ensure you're in the `docs-website` directory.
    2. Hit CONTROL+C to interrupt the yarn process, if necessary.
    3. In GitHub Desktop, commit any changes needed on your branch, and then switch to the develop branch.
    4. Back in the terminal, run `yarn && yarn start`.

  If the site now builds correctly from the develop branch, the issue is with the changes in your branch. Stop Yarn again, go back to your branch, and troubleshoot.

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="clean-cache"
    title="Clean your local cache"
  >
    Run `yarn clean` to blow away your local cache. This will make your next build slower, so make sure you have time!

    1. In the terminal, ensure you're in the docs-website directory.
    2. Hit CONTROL+C to stop yarn, if necessary.
    3. Begin a new build by running `yarn clean && yarn && yarn start`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="remove-cache"
    title="Remove corrupted cache files"
  >
    There may be times when your .cache directory has been corrupted. This directory is ignored by Git, which means that it travels with you from branch to branch. This might be the problem if your local builds are failing regardless of which branch you’re on.

    To solve this from your `/docs-website` directory, run `rm -rf .cache`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="start-build"
    title="Start a build from scratch"
  >
    Starting a build from scratch will blow away all your node modules, hidden .cache folder, and local cache. This takes a long time to run, around 10–20 minutes.

    1. In the terminal, ensure you're in the docs-website directory.
    2. Hit CONTROL+C to stop yarn, if necessary.
    3. Run this command (or the use Keyboard Maestro command `kknuke`*):
      ```
      yarn reboot` in your terminal.
      ```

      *If you use the `kknuke` Keyboard Maestro command, when everything completes, start the site by running `yarn start`.

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="run-incognito"
    title="Run your local build in private mode"
  >
    Sometimes the local site builds, but pages within the site don't. To fix this issue, try running the local build in a private/incognito session. You can also try clearing out your browser's cache.

## A redirect link throws 404 error [#redirect-404]

### Problem

When you click on a redirect link in your local build, you get a 404 error.

### Solution

Redirects take a long time to load in a local build. When you click on a redirect, wait until it throws a 404, and then wait ~1-2 minutes. It should redirect you after a while. If it doesn’t, check the markdown syntax to ensure you set up the redirect correctly.

You can also test the redirects out in the Gatsby build.

## Required build checks fail [#check-fail]

### Problem

A required build check on the PR fails to pass.

#### About build checks

To merge a PR, you only need the `required` checks to pass.  If an optional check fails, it's okay to merge the PR since optional checks don't block releases. But if you want to investigate the check further, message the help channel so the hero can look into the failure.

### Solution

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="rerun-check"
    title="Re-run the check"
  >
    Try re-running the check:
    1. Go to the PR.
    2. Click **Details** > **Re-run jobs**.

    If that doesn't fix it, you probably have genuine build errors. Pull down locally and troubleshoot.
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="reset-check"
    title="Reset the 'build the docs site' build check"
  >
<Callout variant="caution">
  This adds a LOT of time to the build check.
</Callout>

There are times when this check fails. If this happens after your local builds have built successfully, you may need to force a rebuild of the cache.

1. In your local repo, find the file `gatsby-config.js` (use CMD-P to jump to it fast in VSCode).
2. Swap the first and second line of code. It doesn’t matter what order these lines are in, except to make the Gatsby Build check rebuild the cache.

`const fs = require('fs');`

`const parse = require('rehype-parse');`

3. Save the file and commit the change to your PR.
4. Re-run the build checks.
5. Wait a LOOOOONG time.

## PR merge conflicts with develop [#merge-conflict]

### Problem

When you try to create a PR, you get a merge conflict between your branch and develop. 

Merge conflicts can seem pretty scary, but it’s ultimately just deciding between two different versions of a doc. 

Tips:
* Before fixing the conflict, verify the fix looks good locally.
* After fixing the conflict, ask your PR approver to review your PR again. 
* To avoid merge conflicts, try to sync your branch with the develop branch periodically as they can become out-of-sync very quickly:
  1. In Github Desktop, go to your branch.
  2. In your mac menubar, click **Branch** > **Update from develop**.

### Solution

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id=""
    title="Resolve merge conflicts"
  >
You can resolve conflicts either in Github Desktop or in the GitHub browser editor:
* In Github Desktop:
  1. Go to your PR.
  2. Click the option to resolve in VS Code. 
  3. In VS code, address the merge conflict.
* From the GitHub website editor:
1. Go to your PR. 
2. Click the *Resolve merge conflict* button.

### Problem

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id=""
    title="Merge conflicts from What's new posts"
  >
You get a conflict merge with "What's new" posts because the `whats-new-ids.json` file, which is automatically updated when the site builds, can get out-of-date pretty fast.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

### Solution

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id=""
    title=""
  >
If you see changes to the `whats-new-ids.json` file show up in GitHub Desktop, make sure to discard them rather than push them up to your branch. This will make it less likely that other people will have to deal with merge conflicts related to this file.

<Callout variant="caution">
  Never merge a PR that changes `whats-new-ids.json`.
